🧬 Biotech AI Variant Analysis Tool – Full-Stack AI Platform for Genomic Research
Overview:
Developed and deployed a full-stack biotech AI platform that predicts the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using state-of-the-art deep learning (Evo 2). This web application empowers researchers and clinicians to assess the clinical relevance of genetic mutations through a seamless, intuitive interface.

💡 Key Highlights
🔍 Variant Effect Prediction
Integrated Evo 2, a cutting-edge AI model trained on human genome data, to evaluate whether specific genetic mutations are likely benign or disease-causing.

🧠 AI for Genomic Medicine
Translates raw genomic variant data into actionable insights, helping support precision medicine, diagnostics, and gene therapy research.

🌐 End-to-End Web Application

Frontend: Built with Next.js 15, React, and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Modal UI for fast, responsive interaction.

Backend: Python-based FastAPI service running Evo 2 model inference on GPU (via Modal Labs) for scalable bio-AI computation.

🧪 Research-Ready Interface
Designed a user-friendly platform where scientists can input variant positions and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores and visual output.

🚀 Deployment-Grade Architecture
Frontend deployed on Vercel; backend hosted in a GPU-enabled cloud environment. Clean API separation, environment-safe deployment, and scalable design.
