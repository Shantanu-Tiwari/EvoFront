# 🧬 Biotech AI Variant Analysis Tool

A full-stack AI-powered web application for predicting the pathogenicity of genetic variants using **Evo 2**, a state-of-the-art language model trained on genomic data.

This project bridges modern AI with bioinformatics to assist researchers, clinicians, and bioengineers in rapidly evaluating single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for potential disease relevance.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔬 Variant Pathogenicity Prediction**  
  Leverages the **Evo 2** deep learning model to assess the functional impact of genomic mutations in real time.

- **🧠 AI-Powered Genomics**  
  Applies cutting-edge large language models to human genetic data for clinical and research applications.

- **🌐 Full-Stack Architecture**
  - **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js 15**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components.
  - **Backend**: Python + FastAPI server deployed on GPU (via **Modal**) for high-performance model inference.

- **💡 Intuitive Web Interface**  
  Simple, clean UI for entering variant data, viewing prediction results, and exploring scores with confidence.

- **☁️ Cloud-Ready Deployment**  
  Fully deployable using **Vercel** (frontend) and **Modal** or other cloud providers (backend).
